# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression  

## Overview  
This project builds a **Machine Learning (ML)** model using **Linear Regression** to predict salaries based on education level, job title, and years of experience. The model is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interactively predict salaries.  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains:  
- **Input Features (X):**  
  - `education_level_encoder` - Encoded education level  
  - `job_title_encoder` - Encoded job title  
  - `Years of Experience` - Total years of experience  
- **Target Variable (y):**  
  - `Salary` - Predicted salary  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
